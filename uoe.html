                The University of Edinburgh (Scots: University o Edinburgh, Scottish 
                Gaelic: Oilthigh Dhùn Èideann; abbreviated as Edin. in post-nominals) 
                is a public research university in Edinburgh, Scotland. Granted a royal 
                charter by King James VI in 1582 and officially opened in 1583, it is 
                one of Scotland's four ancient universities and the sixth-oldest 
                university in continuous operation in the English-speaking world. The 
                university played an important role in Edinburgh becoming a chief 
                intellectual centre during the Scottish Enlightenment and contributed 
                to the city being nicknamed the "Athens of the North".
                <br><br>

                I used to wander around different places in Edinburgh City, whatever 
                college libraries, workshops, studios or etc. It is a charming place 
                that inspires my ambition to see the world as well.
                <br><br>

                Although the University of Edinburgh did not bring me directly to the 
                current cutting-edge domain, I offer excellent opportunities for me to 
                see this world, especially letting me understand why my pursuits only 
                have more esteem and chances in the States. Studying in the commonwealth 
                did not bring solid knowledge to me since it looks more like delicate 
                china but has no practical usage, whereas its potential use -- a way 
                to go to the States-- means a lot to me. So I am still grateful for that 
                period in the UK.
